title: The secret affair between Reinforcement Learning and k-Nearest Neighbours

The paper [Q-learning with Nearest Neighbors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03900.pdf) has 
an interesting idea: what happens when we fuse together Reinforcement Learning and k-Nearest Neighbours?

I personally like the mathematical analysis, where they get some very interesting non-asymptotic guarantees. 

To have a running post I'm going to go about it like mother Nature: I'll grow it organically, it feels right. The main equation they get

$T=C_0\frac{L_{h^*}}{}$
