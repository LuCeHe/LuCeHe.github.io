I have been reading on the project  recently came

[Minerva University Project](

)


I think some of you are going to like some of these articles. They were 
cited on the book I bought on the project Minerva, they want to start 
the university of the 21st century from scratch, interesting project, 
they train critical thinking, creativity, effective interaction and effective 
communication. They have a few citations and I'm checking right now the most recent ones.

[Evaluating creativity of scientists üôÇ](

)

"Now that the creative person in general is better understood, the
next question arises: To what extent are these psychological influences on creative thought and behavior domain specific or domain
general?"

"More formally, Simonton defines creativity as c  (1 ‚Äì p)u(1 ‚Äì v)"

"In the
current study, we have concentrated on the two most widely
adopted structural models of personality: the Five Factor Model
(FFM) and Eysenck‚Äôs Gigantic 3."

The big 5 "five bipolar factors: openness (imaginative‚Äîdown-to-earth), conscientiousness (well organized‚Äîdisorganized), extraversion (outgoing‚Äîreserved), agreeableness (trusting‚Äîsuspicious), and neuroticism
(anxious‚Äî calm), which are placed on the continuum" and for the Eysenck's "neuroticism, extraversion, and psychoticism. Neuroticism and extraversion are essentially the same as the
Big Five‚Äôs. Psychoticism is a bipolar dimension with altruistic,
controlled, and socialized on one side of the continuum and aggressive, impulsive and hostile on the other"

"Higher scores on psychoticism allow people to be
‚Äúoverinclusive‚Äù in their thinking and operate with a larger sample
of ideas, making the formation of novel and unusual combinations
more attainable"

"Some researchers have reported that personality characteristics
have greater influence on creative achievement than cognitive
abilities, such as intelligence"
