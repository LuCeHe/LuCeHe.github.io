I have been reading on the project  recently came

[Minerva University Project](

I think some of you are going to like some of these articles. They were 
cited on the book I bought on the project Minerva, they want to start 
the university of the 21st century from scratch, interesting project, 
they train critical thinking, creativity, effective interaction and effective 
communication. They have a few citations and I'm checking right now the most recent ones.
