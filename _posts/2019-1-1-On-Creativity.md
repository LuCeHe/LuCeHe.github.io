I have been reading on the project  recently came

[Minerva University Project](
https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/building-intentional-university
)


I think some of you are going to like some of these articles. They were 
cited on the book I bought on the project Minerva, they want to start 
the university of the 21st century from scratch, interesting project, 
they train critical thinking, creativity, effective interaction and effective 
communication. They have a few citations and I'm checking right now the most recent ones.

[Evaluating creativity of scientists üôÇ](
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263916095_The_Creative_Person_in_Science
)

"Now that the creative person in general is better understood, the
next question arises: To what extent are these psychological influences on creative thought and behavior domain specific or domain
general?"

"More formally, Simonton defines creativity as c  (1 ‚Äì p)u(1 ‚Äì v)"

"In the
current study, we have concentrated on the two most widely
adopted structural models of personality: the Five Factor Model
(FFM) and Eysenck‚Äôs Gigantic 3."

The big 5 "five bipolar factors: openness (imaginative‚Äîdown-to-earth), conscientiousness (well organized‚Äîdisorganized), extraversion (outgoing‚Äîreserved), agreeableness (trusting‚Äîsuspicious), and neuroticism
(anxious‚Äî calm), which are placed on the continuum" and for the Eysenck's "neuroticism, extraversion, and psychoticism. Neuroticism and extraversion are essentially the same as the
Big Five‚Äôs. Psychoticism is a bipolar dimension with altruistic,
controlled, and socialized on one side of the continuum and aggressive, impulsive and hostile on the other"

"Higher scores on psychoticism allow people to be
‚Äúoverinclusive‚Äù in their thinking and operate with a larger sample
of ideas, making the formation of novel and unusual combinations
more attainable"

"Some researchers have reported that personality characteristics
have greater influence on creative achievement than cognitive
abilities, such as intelligence"

"According to Feist,
creative people in general share a number of personality traits.
They are more autonomous, introverted, open to experience,
driven, and impulsive"

"However, there are some differences between creative artists 
and scientists. Creative artists tend to be emotionally unstable, 
sensitive, imaginative, and impulsive, whereas creative scientists 
are arrogant, self-confident, ambitious, and autonomous"

"Some researchers have reported that personality characteristics
have greater influence on creative achievement than cognitive abilities, such as intelligence"

"As a result, more creative scientists scored lower on conscientiousness and agreeableness."

‚Äúbiologicalfunctional model of personality.‚Äù

"Many researchers have agreed that publication and citation
counts are reliable and robust measures of creative output in
science"

" Moreover, we defined creative product as ‚Äúnew-anduseful‚Äù and, thus, we suggest accessing the novelty aspect of the
scientific product by calculating the total number of publications
produced by a scientist, and the usefulness aspect by calculating
how often this publication was cited.
"

"the h-index and
the creativity index‚Äîthat correct for the number of self-citations,"

"Hypotheses
Based on the findings from previous research studies, we predicted positive relationships between creativity and the personality
traits of openness and neuroticism (G. J. Feist, 1998). Creativity
and agreeableness, on the other hand, would be negatively correlated (Feist, 1993; G. J. Feist & Barron, 2003). Creativity and
psychoticism would be positively correlated, and highly creative
scientists would score higher on the trait of psychoticism than less
creative peers (H. J. Eysenck, 1993). Moreover, we predicted that
these relationships would hold once covariates, such as career age
and sex, are held constant."

" As predicted, all creativity measures (the overall creativity score, Ci, h-index, and creativity index), except Pi, correlated significantly and positively to openness"
"openness does not have direct influence on the productivity of a scientist and mostly affects their impact on the field"
"Contrary to prediction, the most productive, creative scientists were lower rather than higher on psychoticism. The correlation for Pi and psychoticism was r =- .19 (p  .05), and for psychoticism and h-index, r =- .18 (p  .05)."

"Interestingly, sex did not correlate with overall creativity, suggesting that men and women are equally creative in their scientific productivity."
